# Test Prints

These are models for doing test prints. You can use these to check that your printer is calibrated well enough to print the parts for a Voron. For best results, print the test prints with the [same settings as the actual Voron printed parts](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing.html#print-settings).

## Thread Tests

The thread test STLs have two parts which should screw together easily if your print is dialed in. For `Thread_Test_1` and `Thread_Test_2`, you can also check that a 608 bearing press-fits into them.

## Voron Cube

The Voron cube has overhangs and bridges - check that these print well. It also has a hole on top which should accept a 608 bearing.

## Filament card

You can print the filament card as an example of what a filament looks like. The caddy holds 25 filament cards.
