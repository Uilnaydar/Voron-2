# Test Prints

These are models for doing test prints. You can use these to check that your printer is calibrated well enough to print the parts for a Voron. For best results, print the test prints with the [same settings as the actual Voron printed parts](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing.html#print-settings).

## Thread Tests

The thread test STLs have two parts which should screw together easily if your print is dialed in. For `Thread_Test_1` and `Thread_Test_2`, you can also check that a 608 bearing press-fits into them.

## Voron Cube

The Voron cube tests overhangs, bridging, ringing, and print accuracy. You can see your bridge though the center cutout window. Both the bearing sizes used in the Voron 2 are in the top and bottom. If you can press your bearing in by hand your printer will work with whatever settings you used to make the cube.  If you can't press the bearings in by hand continue to reduce your extrusion multi/flow until they can or figure out what is mechanically astray with your printer.

## Filament card

You can print the filament card as an example of what a filament looks like. The caddy holds 25 filament cards.
